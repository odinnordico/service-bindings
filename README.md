Service Bindings for Kubernetes implements the [Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes](https://servicebinding.io/). We are tracking changes to the spec as it approaches a stable release (currently targeting [RC3](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec/tree/v1.0.0-rc3)). Backwards and forwards compatibility should not be expected for alpha versioned resources.

This implementation provides support for:
- [Provisioned Service](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec/tree/v1.0.0-rc3#provisioned-service)
- [Workload Projection](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec/tree/v1.0.0-rc3#workload-projection)
- [Service Binding](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec/tree/v1.0.0-rc3#service-binding)
- [Direct Secret Reference](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec/tree/v1.0.0-rc3#direct-secret-reference)
- [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec/tree/v1.0.0-rc3#role-based-access-control-rbac)

The following are not implemented:
- [Workload Resource Mapping](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec/tree/v1.0.0-rc3#workload-resource-mapping)
- Extensions including:
  - [Binding Secret Generation Strategies](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec/blob/v1.0.0-rc3/extensions/secret-generation.md)

## Try it out

Prerequisites:
- a Kubernetes 1.18+ cluster

Using the [latest release](https://github.com/vmware-labs/service-bindings/releases/latest) is recommended.

### Build from source

We use [Golang](https://golang.org) and [`ko`](https://github.com/google/ko) to build the CRD and reconciler, and [`kapp`](https://get-kapp.io) to deploy them.

From within the cloned directory for this project, run:

```
kapp deploy -a service-bindings -f <(ko resolve -f config)
```

#### Uninstall

```
kapp delete -a service-bindings
```

## Collecting logs from service binding manager

Retrieve pod logs from the `manager` running in the `service-bindings` namespace.

  ```bash
  kubectl -n service-bindings logs -l role=manager
  ```

For example:

  ```bash

  2021/11/05 15:25:28 Registering 3 informer factories

## Troubleshooting

For basic troubleshooting Service Bindings, please see the troubleshooting guide [here](./docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Samples

Samples are located in the [samples directory](./samples), including:

- [Spring PetClinic with MySQL](./samples/spring-petclinic)
- [Controlled Resource](./samples/controlled-resource)
- [Overridden Type and Provider](./samples/overridden-type-provider)
- [Provisioned Service](./samples/provisioned-service)
- [Multiple Bindings](./samples/multi-binding)

## Resources

### ServiceBinding (servicebinding.io/v1alpha3)

The `ServiceBinding` resource shape and behavior is defined by the spec.

```
apiVersion: servicebinding.io/v1alpha3
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: account-db
spec:
  service:
    apiVersion: bindings.labs.vmware.com/v1alpha1
    kind: ProvisionedService
    name: account-db
  workload:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: account-service
```

### ProvisionedService (bindings.labs.vmware.com/v1alpha1)

The `ProvisionedService` exposes a resource `Secret` by implementing the upstream [Provisioned Service duck type](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec#provisioned-service), and may be the target of the `.spec.service` reference for a `ServiceBinding`. It is intended for compatibility with existing services that do not directly implement the duck type.

For example to expose a service with an existing `Secret` named `account-db-service`:

```
apiVersion: bindings.labs.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: ProvisionedService
metadata:
  name: account-db
spec:
  binding:
    name: account-db-service

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: account-db-service
type: Opaque
stringData:
  type: mysql
  # use appropriate values
  host: localhost
  database: default
  password: ""
  port: "3306"
  username: root
```

The controller writes the resource's status to implement the duck type.

## Acknowledgements

Service Bindings for Kubernetes is an implementation of the [Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec). Thanks to [Arthur De Magalhaes](https://github.com/arthurdm) and [Ben Hale](https://github.com/nebhale) for leading the spec effort. 

The initial implementation was conceived in [`projectriff/bindings`](https://github.com/projectriff/bindings/) by [Scott Andrews](https://github.com/scothis), [Emily Casey](https://github.com/ekcasey) and the [riff community](https://github.com/orgs/projectriff/people) at large, drawing inspiration from [mattmoor/bindings](https://github.com/mattmoor/bindings) and [Knative](https://knative.dev) duck type reconcilers.
